L.E.G.O. Net: Enhancing Melanoma Detection with Synthetic Data and Vision Transformers

Introduction

Melanoma is a significant cause of skin cancer-related deaths due to its aggressive nature and high potential for metastasis. Early detection is critical for improving patient outcomes, as highlighted by recent studies【Bø-Sande et al., 2023】【Kim et al., 2024】. Traditional diagnostic approaches often face challenges such as limited labeled data and class imbalances, particularly with fewer malignant cases【Ha, Liu, Liu, 2020】.

To address these issues, we present the Locally Enhanced Graphic Observations Network (L.E.G.O. Net), a deep learning framework designed to generate synthetic images and enhance systems for melanoma diagnosis. L.E.G.O. Net utilizes synthetic data augmentation to improve dataset robustness and leverages Vision Transformers to understand spatial and contextual relationships in medical images.
